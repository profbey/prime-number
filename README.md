This application checks whether a range() received from the user is a prime number or not.


# At this stage, the last print(prime_numbers) value must be exported as a .txt file.
# When exporting the .txt file, the name should be 'primeNumbTXT_{initial Numb}_{finalNumb}.txt'

## Two options should be given as query and generation with the interface. 
## According to the selection, two different code directories should be run.
